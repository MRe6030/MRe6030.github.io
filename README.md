Website for CPSC6030 Final Visualization

This project aims to visualize some of YouTube's trending data from February an March 2021.

**The video detailing the website and the data is found at the bottom of the webpage. Depending on your computer's monitor size, you might have to scroll down to see it.**

In total, our dataset contained about 6000 rows of data (for just the USA). Each row contains information about a trending video. If we only want to look at unique videos, then we have about 1020 data points.

The goal of this project was to attempt to find patterns in youtube's trending videos. We can look for these patterns by clicking on the bars in the bar chat, clicking on squares in the treemap, or zooming in on the treemap and bubblemap. 

Both of the zoom-able visualizations have dedicated reset buttons in the top left corner of the visualization to reset the zoom and the pan. To reset the selected category back to show the data for all the categories, click on the white reset button above the bar chart.
