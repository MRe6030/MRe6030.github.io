The index.html main landing page is a youtube "profile page". Each of the "videos" is a visualization that answers the question asked in the video's title. Clicking on the thumbnail or the title of the video will take you to that question's page.

Once you're on a questions page, You can experiment with each of the visualizations. Some of them are embedded Tableau visualizations, so Tableau provides a way to fullscreen the vis in the bottom right corner of the vis.

Hitting the "show description" will do what the name of the button implies.

To return to the profile page, you can either click on the channel name "CPSC6030 - DataVis" located at the bottom of the page or click on youtube's thumbnail in the top left corner.

Currently, the search bar does not do anything. Soonâ„¢.
